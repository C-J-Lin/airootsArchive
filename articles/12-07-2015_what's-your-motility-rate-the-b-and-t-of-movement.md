*Our office in Shivaji Nagar is treated to streams of chai through out the day – most days of the
year. However – there are sudden droughts that punctuate this experience. This piece explains
such momentary lapses and what they actually mean...*

The academic field of mobility (with a ‘b’) has thrown up many concepts in the last couple of
decades – out of which, that of ‘motility’ (with a ‘t’) is particularly intriguing. Coined by Vincent
Kauffman in 2002, it refers to resources that enable people to move from one place to another.
These include access to transport, income levels and skills needed to access necessary
infrastructures of movement. However – and this is where ‘b’ becomes ‘t’ – the concept is
crucially predicated on whether a person can actually activate an aspiration or choice to do
either – remain sedentary or become mobile. The *capacity* to be mobile is a resource – a wealth
in itself – Kauffman argues. And this is really tested through the ability to use it at will – the
crucial something that distinguishes a highly motile person from one who is merely mobile.
What the concept of motility also does is caution us about the slippery quality of the word
mobility – which can delude us into believing that increased physical mobility is attractive and
desirable in itself. And it can somehow increase social mobility as well. There is a kind of
accepted idea that people will move up the economic ladder as they start moving about more
easily (bigger markets, more migration to lucrative areas etc.)

It is for this reason that governments can invest billions of dollars in infrastructure related to
faster transport – on the faith that it will provide increased opportunities for socio-economic
mobility as well. This accelerates into policies encouraging smart cities with fast mobility
networks – so on and so forth...

It is on such an intersection of presumed social and physical mobility that the concept of motility
is located – by sharply reminding us that the concept of mobility needs a qualification.
The capacity to be mobile needs to be infused by resources that enhance genuine choices –
and that includes that of remaining sedentary and controlling how and when one chooses to
move.

Anyone who has been forced to be a commuter, following clockwork rhythms of movement for
the sake of livelihood – basically most of humanity today -will immediately recognize this.
People who can choose when to have a holiday, when to go to work or have the freedom to
draft their own timetable are finally the ones with high motility.

So while it is important to celebrate and laud the latest advances in transport technology –
especially if it overcomes one more barrier of speed and distance – it makes sense to locate
ourselves within the motility index and check how much of that advance can be accessed by us
or others.

Now – while the concept is a powerful one in terms of helping us differentiate between those
who have the choices to travel and those who don’t – it is also important to locate those choices
not just in terms of access and resources – but other more insidiously social factors.
This is where the question of accessing cheap modes of travel over great distances or
possessing enough security to allow people to make choices to move or not at their
convenience – whether they are rich or poor – becomes important. And it is at this point we can
take the concept of motility out of resource rich Europe where it originated – and test it in a place like India. If motility is relatively high even in the context of India – then we know the
concept needs to be paid greater attention to – and that it is alluding to other things besides
simply material resources.

This can be understood better using an analogy from another field altogether – communication
technology. While it is true that instantaneous communication collapses distances – it is also
true that if social barriers continue to exist – people in the same room won’t be able to
communicate with each other at all. If we just needed to be physically close to each other to
communicate better – then we would not have breakdowns within families. Anthropologists
typically like to point out that the biggest barriers to good communication are often not just
technological or based on physical distance but social. Age, gender, ethnicity can act as huge
barriers of their own.

It must be immediately said of course that technological advancements in communication are
extraordinarily important and nothing can be more precious to modern life than the ability to
reach out so quickly and over vast distances the way we do now. What the above observation
does is point at something a bit more tangential but important nevertheless – that what modern
technologies also facilitate is the break down of social barriers – wherever possible. Social
media deliberately uses informal rhetoric – mimicking friendship (relatively more egalitarian) as
opposed to kinship (hierarchical). Thus while it obviously collapses physical barriers in
communication it is wildly powerful also because it also helps break down social distance as
well – whether in terms of how we speak and relate to each other – or the style of language –
and its accompanying irreverence, or how we all become empowered as journalists, reporters,
film makers or how we relate to celebrities and have access to authority in a way we never did
before.

Motility – in a completely different realm – helps us understand the world of physical mobility
much in the same way. It connects it immediately to a more complicated trajectory of social
restrictions and possibilities and helps us focus on things beyond high speed and instant
connectivity.

High-speed trains are good. Faster travel is amazing. And yet – if they are yoked to a lifestyle of
greater restrictions on time – then more mobility gets cancelled out by low motility.
Take a look at India’s largest, cheapest and most extensive mobility and transport network – the
medieval, lumbering railways lost somewhere between diesel steam punk and colonial memory
– which refuses to cross the 80 kilometer per hour speed limit on an average. As a giant
bureaucracy it is also doing its best to stymie ambitions of introducing high-speed trains –with
remarkable and uncharacteristic efficiency.

Is there anything redeeming in this rumbling creature? We feel there is. From the days when it
started re-structuring India’s urban landscapes from a water-based mobility network to a train
based one – this highly intricate and cheap mode of moving people and goods has managed to
enhance the choices of the country’s poorer segments like few other systems have managed on
that scale.

While the quest for livelihood, escape from hunger, and all other instigators of migration hold
true for the millions who moved to big cities thanks to the railways – the fact that they also had a
choice of going back – often continuing to live two lives – using their families as a tool of
enhancing motility – became a powerful mode of security as well. In fact cultural factors like the
joint family, the traditional semi-nomadic propensity of our multi-tasking peasants who doubled
up as soldiers in armies or small – time traders, indicates a highly mobile society – even before
the railways.

In fact Mariam Aguiar – in her comprehensive documentation of the Indian rail in her work
*Tracking Modernity* (2011) – points out how the Indian railway in the initial years loved to locate
itself in a narrative of bringing in mobility to a static society, which she considers to be blatantly
false. In fact Indians were already mobile – across castes and class – and the routes of
movements moved in all directions. Sacred geographies or political exigencies – economic
quests or adventurism – produced a rich bandwidth of choices in many directions. The railways
she says, initially restricted movements from point to point along a linear path usually aimed at
reaching a port city as fast as possible. Several journeys in other directions were actually culled.

However – it were the highly mobile users of the trains themselves who managed to act as a
pressure group and eventually helped expand the network over several decades. By remaining
both extensive and cheap the railways had to keep expanding choices for a people who already
had a heightened sense of mobility. Their families and communities helped them maintain dual
domestic locations and the movement to and fro – which we call Circulatory Urbanism –
eventually shape their habitats in villages and cities.

Unfortunately in India, this special phenomenon of mobility-infused urban life is mostly
considered to be problematic. Service providers and workers who contribute to the city’s
economy are considered to be unreliable players – viewed as undisciplined and volatile.
Disgruntled employers complain about how they vanish to their villages at erratic times, families
bemoan their drivers and maids who rush off to their native place just when they need them.
