  Rebecca Houze in her essay ‘The Textile as Structural Framework: Gottfried Semper’s
Bekleidungsprinzip and the case of Vienna 1900” (2006) analyses how significantly Europe’s
rich traditions of textile design interwove itself into architectural practices.
Semper was one of the few architects who engaged with the dimension of architecture that was
connected to weaving and the textile industry. She explains: “The concept of cloth as a
symbolic building material is contained in Semper’s enormous, unfinished compendium, ‘Style in
the Technical and Tectonic Arts; or, Practical Aesthetics’ (2004 [1870-73]). The first and longest 
volume of this text is devoted to a detailed analysis of the textile arts. Architecture, according to
Semper, originated in the primordial need to demarcate interior and exterior spaces with
dividers–fencing made of branches, for example, or hanging tapestries of woven grasses. Some
of the earliest built structures were temporary tents of real cloth stretched over scaffoldings,
often festively decorated with garlands, ribbons, and other kinds of soft ornament that today we
might characterize as “fiber art” (Semper 2004 [1870-3]; Wilson 1995: 42-8).

  While the use of new materials was absorbed into modern construction practices, what
characterized Europe’s dominance in the world of architecture and design was building on its
rich traditions of textile related creativity.

  Anybody familiar with Indian history will immediately be compelled to make comparisons. And
recognize the wide gap that existed and exists between artisanal practices and the development
of institutional knowledge linked to contemporary design related professions.

  While the great architectural schools, and specialized institutions dedicated to design have paid
academic attention to the enormous resource embodied in India’s artisanal traditions, especially
textiles, a translation into practice has not always been as successful.

  What is particularly relevant to us about Semper’s observation about architecture is that he sees
textiles as integral to its evolution, along with the world of masonry, ironwork and carpentry.
European architectural practice seemed to have built on technological innovation of physical
materials along with integrating design processes of textiles into it. They evolved masonry,
ironwork and carpentry, making technological breakthroughs while also letting loose
imaginations from the world of textile design to produce an aesthetic – either through restraint or
elaboration – that continues to dominate architectural practice globally.

that sustain them, became enormously challenging to say the least.

  Nevertheless, there were some attempts made in that direction. Government initiatives to
preserve artisanal traditions were reasonably funded and their attempts to be integrated into
contemporary economic exchanges were partially successful – but the difficulty in reconciling
caste based modes of organization with them remained difficult.

  This contrarian challenge lies at the heart of many urban realities in India and confound visitors.
Its poorest neighbourhoods inevitably have some of the most formidable talent and skill in fields
as diverse as embroidery, leather work, intricate wood-carving, stone sculpting and others. It is
not uncommon to see exquisite craftsmanship embedded in simple designs up for sale in
grubby shops on polluted streets. Dharavi, Mumbai’s most well-known settlement that has the
distinction of being referred to as a slum, is also considered to be the most productive space in
the city. Traditional skills of ironwork, textiles and pottery constantly adapt, like these skills have
always done, to contemporary economic needs. In Dharavi, its not just old leather work, that are
sold in shops in India and abroad, but manual skills that have adapted to new needs of
technologies connected to computers, mobile phones and automobiles also thrive. Not being
able to deal with the social and economic knots into which these highly prized skills are tied, has
made India pay a huge price, evident in its poor social and economic indicators and
under-serviced urban neighbourhoods.
  
   Another example of this state of affairs has been the inability to build on design traditions that
were enmeshed in India’s textile related artisanal histories and weave them creatively into a
contemporary sensibility of building and architecture. While Indian talent tied down directly to
those traditions seem to have made some sort of mark in the field of fashion design,
architectural practice in India does not seem to have built as seriously on those traditions.

  The most recognized and renowned architectural practice in India today – is typically embodied
in the hugely successful work of an architect like Bijoy Jain, who has developed a practice
connected deeply to local artisans. He involves carpentry, iron smith and stone work into his
studio that works like a collective crafts workshop. His strength has been recognising these
processes and developing an elegant framework around them. His emerging aesthetic often
reminds one of Japan, which constitutes a story of similar encounters with crafts and
architectural practices.

  However, Jain’s work is so authentically embedded in traditional arrangements that they echo
some of the problems connected to the socio-economic knots we refer to above. Just as
artisanship could not quite escape royal patronage in the past – in fact it thrived on it – India’s
peculiar caste story traps Jain’s practice in much the same way. His dependence on rich clients
does not allow genuine experimentations in aesthetic terms as well as to explore new markets.
It may well happen that in the coming years, more innovative young architects from India try to
consciously evoke the Semper moment by building on design elements from textiles and
interweave them into contemporary building materials and practices by combining them
creatively with Jain’s processes.

  One such Mumbai-based architect, already exploring these themes, and someone we work with
closely, is Sameep Padora. Coming from a family historically involved with carpet weaving,
originally from Kashmir, he builds on textures of textiles and combines them skilfully into
structural principles using parametrics modeling, to come out with flexible and sound designs
that move through all kinds of contexts. His works exist in luxurious shopping malls but also
slide easily into Shivaji Nagar, Govandi, a re-settlement colony in north-west Mumbai, where he
worked with us to experiment with light construction material to create a roof-top office. He
exhibited artefacts that residents could use in their homes as well. What we find particularly
striking about Padora’s approach is his ability to be adventurous with material, weave in the 
flexibility of light and heavy moments, derive an aesthetic from all kinds of sources including
textiles and carpet weaving, and work with artisanal skills in the way we find most productive –
well adapted to contemporary and even futuristic technological and economic needs.
